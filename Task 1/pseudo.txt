Task 1.1

create a variable to hold a list of intergers called int_list

Ask user to input a  positive number and append this to the list of numbers

While the number given is not equal to 0
	Ask user to input a positive number and add this to the int_list variable

create a variable to contain the highest number given and call it highest_given_number and set it to 0 (at this point in the code a 0 will have been given)

loop through each element in the int_list
	if current index element is greater than the highest number given variable
		set highest_number_given to the current indexed element of the list of numbers
		
Print highest_given_number (at this point the loop would have iterated over the entirety of int_list

Task 1.2

Get arbitrary number of integers

create a variable to store the final sum of the number of integers called sum_of_numbers and set it to 0

loop over the abitrary number of integers
	add the current indexed element to the sum_of_numbers

print sum_of_numbers divided by the amount of numbers in the arbitrary list of numbers

Task 1.3

Get a grocery list and input it into a variable call grocery_list (this variable will be stored as a string array)

create a variable called current_product (this is to contain the current alphabetical product)

loop the below code an amount of times equal to the amount of products in grocery_list
	loop through grocery_list
		if the current index element should come before current_product or current_product is equal to an empty string
			then set current_product to the current indexed element
		
		print current_product (at this point the for loop has gone through the grocery list and has found what product should be first in alphabetical order
		remove the current_product from the grocery list (we do this so an item we have found to be the first in alphabetical order does not get found again)
	


Task 1.4

Get input from user and store in a variable called X
Get input from user and store in a variable called Y

Create a variable called S and set it to X + Y 
Create a variable called A and set it to S / 2
Create a variable called P and set it to X * Y

print S + ", " + A + ", " + P (this will print the individual variables with a comma and a space between them)
