Ask user to input 4 numbers and store in a variable called list_of_numbers
create an empty list of numbers variable called ordered_list_of_numbers
loop this code an amount of times equal to the amount of numbers in list_of_numbers
	loop over the list_of_numbers using the index from the first loop (this is so we can compare this number to the other numbers we have been given)
		If the first loops index is the smallest in the list_of_numbers and is not already in ordered_list_of_numbers
			append this number to ordered_list_of_numbers



print ordered_list_of_numbers
